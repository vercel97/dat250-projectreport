\section{The Software Technology}
\label{sec:background}

About 4 pages that introduces in (sufficient) depth the key concepts
and architecture of the technology.  May use a running example to
introduce the technology.

This part and other parts of the report probably needs to refer to
figures. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} from \cite{brown:96} just
illustrates how figure can be included in the report.
